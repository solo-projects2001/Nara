# NARA UX PRINCIPLES

1. No hidden state is ever shown as magic.
2. All outputs are explainable or rejected.
3. Failure is explicit and classified.
4. Ambiguity causes stop, not guessing.
5. UX must never bypass policy.
6. UX is replaceable; core is sacred.
7. Human operators are first-class users.
